[MASTER]

## Set up a black-list of various things
ignore=.git
ignore=doc
ignore=build


[MESSAGES CONTROL]

## Disable messages that are particularly spammy:
##   I0011: Locally disabling %s
disable=I0011


[REPORTS]

## Make sure message-ids are present in the output to make it easy to add
## them to the ignore list if they are spammy.
include-ids=yes

## We don't need the full report, just a list of diagnostics
reports=no


[BASIC]

## Modified to allow assignment of globals named "main"
const-rgx=(([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)|(__.*__)|main)$


[FORMAT]

## We expect single-tab indents (not spaces)
indent-string='\t'


[TYPECHECK]

## Some classes have dynamically-created member attributes, so ignore them
## when verifying that member attributes exist
ignored-classes=Namespace

## Some members are dynamically generated (such as by pymox)
generated-members=AndRaise,AndReturn,InAnyOrder,MultipleTimes


[CLASSES]

## Not sure what this does, but the default has only zope-specific methods
ignore-iface-methods=

## These methods may assign instance attributes for the first time
defining-attr-methods=__new__,__init__


[DESIGN]

## Disable some warnings and adjust other defaults so they aren't stupidly
## pedantic about code architecture.
min-public-methods=0
